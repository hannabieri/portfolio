          <b>Beginner’s-Mistake</b> <br>
          In the beginning, I made a typical „beginner-mistake“ which I should have known better – I started right away with colours, images and fonts. This led to me being unsatisfied with the look and feel of the first page, before even having a
          structure, contents and a concept! I spent nearly a week of dissatisfaction before I could convince myself to take a step back and start with „wireframes“ in a more typical way. <br><br>
          Wireframes helped a lot with focusing more on the key things rather than already getting lost in visual details before having a core foundation. Like this, I started to create the content as a base for the further editing and designing
          later on. <br><br>

          <b>Grid</b> <br>
          Also, I finally introduced the highly needed grid into my design drafts. Surprisingly, the grid actually helped me a lot, also with the actual design! I always thought the grid would rather have a limiting effect on my visual designs, but
          in this case, it helped a lot for finding a better structuring, working on the hierarchies and therefore, in the end providing a better experience.

        <h3> Visual Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          From this point onwards, I mainly focused on the project pages and let the starting-page rest for later on. I tried different web fonts, styles, uses of color and also placements. It was a <b>challanging part to find a
            direction which felt like it represents me well</b> and also satisfies my expectations, without being too perfectionistic. <br>
          A next point was also to find ways of presenting the image, pictures, screens and works in a good, suitable way. From a very phone-like mockup at first, I started to try out more abstract
          versions with just colors as frames which lets the user focus on the content.<br><br><br>
          These were some further experiments of different splash-parts, to figure out which one works the best in different use cases and also which one represents the given content best:

        <h3> Content Reduction</h3>
        <p>
          The whole page is quite text-heavy, as it’s crucial to describe projects, their background and the concept and decisions that were made.
          <b>What works well on a desktop screen through users being used to endless scrolls, might be a big pain to mobile users and even make them feel frustrated.</b><br>

          I decided to reduce the displayed content through collapsable areas. This way, the reader still gets a feeling but is not overwhelmed by the amount of text. <br><br>
          I was considering to even remove certain parts of the page/specific paragraphs for the mobile version to provide a lighter experience, but then decided against it as it <em>is</em> all about the content and therefore I decided to not reduce
          it any
          further.

        <h3> Device features</h3>
        <p>
          • To encourage action, I made use of the device features when programming. To increase conversion, the buttons of email, Instagram and LinkedIn guide you directly to the according app if installed on a mobile phone. <br><br>
          • This can also be applied to email addresses, opening a new message in an email app and auto-fill that email as the recipient, when clicked. Social media icons can also be coded in such a way that when clicked if installed on that person’s
          phone, it will open directly in the app as opposed to a mobile browser.<br><br>
          • This should ultimately make it easier for the visitors/users to connect and communicate.

        <p>
          This was the first time I’ve worked with a CSS-Grid. As it was a whole new thing to me, it was obviously also quite confusing in the beginning. I found it amazing and fascinating, but also couldn’t fully see how I can make
          use of it in the best possible way.
          So I decided to do some online tutorials at first, which helped me to gain a better understanding for grids and their usage.<br>
          It was a tricky task for me, but also a lot of fun to get to know that new feature of CSS.

        <h3> Increased readability</h3>
        <p>
          Towards the „finish“, I’ve also reworked the content and added some highlights as well as breaks to the text. Like this, it now looks way easier to quickly scan through a side or to easily grasp the main points and core messages.

      <div class="project_box_subtitle">
        <h3> Another learning:  Github</h3>
        <p>
          One last thing: I’ve also used Github for the first time in this project. As I’ve published my page via Github Pages, it seemed sensible to start using Github early on. So that’s been my first time using the command line to add & commit,
          push and pull (although, mainly push!). <br><br>
          It’s been amazing, as it saved me the step of using a service like Cyberduck or FileStream every time I’ve made a little change to see what it looks like online. So much smoother this way.
