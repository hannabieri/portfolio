        <h3> THE <b> PROBLEM</b></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_left">
        <p> We spend our time working in offices. Usually 8 hours a day, five days per week. That’s 160 hours per month and 1920 hours per year. There are plenty of studies showing the undoubtable relationship between the physical space and business
          performance metrics, productivity, and what employees value. But way too often, office space is a blind spot. Mid-sized companies in urban areas struggle to find easy and natural- feeling ways of enhancing their team dynamic and exchange
          whereas at the same time, often an awareness for the actual office space surrounding employees on a daily base is missing.</p>

        <h3> THE Design <b>Challenge</b></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_right">
        <p>The challenge in this project was on one hand its broadness, but also bringing it together with the intended technology. A central question was about how we might create workspaces which allow focused work and reduce noise-distraction. Is
          it possible to contribute to a better working-experience through technology and design? And how might we bring more sustainability and environmental awareness into office workspaces and offices? And could this even contribute to
          strengthening the (social) connections between different departments in a company? </p>

      <div class="project_box_title_left">
        <h3> Our <b> SOLUTION</b></h3>

      <div class="project_box_description_left">
        <p> We’ve created a product which adds to a work-friendlier environment,
          increases productivity and even helps companies to enhance the happiness of their employees.  <br><br>
          With a vertical hydroponic system of Rowa, we provide you a solution which helps companies to improve their physical space easily, it helps to enhance exchange within colleagues and encourage breaks during work days by adding a fun,
          interesting factor to break up and enrich routines.  <br><br>
          Additionally, it contributes to educate and support the reduction of waste and carbon footprint of fresh produce.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_left plus2">
        <p>
          Qualitative Research, semi-structured interviews

          I started with B2C interviews & questions in public locations (e.g. shops). The main target hereby was to reach health- and environment- aware people in urban areas. Also, I casually asked people I knew some questions to find out more about
          the direction to go. Key learning out of the B2C-interviews: It seems like there are pain points, for example, lacking fresh and local products, packaging which seemed to come up a lot, price- and quality-balance as an issue, effort and
          time-consumption of alternatives. At the same time, it seemed like the “suffering” isn’t big enough to actually take proactive steps towards changes and alternatives.

          At the same time, we’ve also held interviews at companies. Whilst doing so, there were some very interesting fields and opportunities opening up. For example, the desire for a strong team culture came up, bosses told us that they’re willing
          to take their employees for lunch bi-weekly, team culture seemed emphasized again and again. As well the point of space came up, additional accountability and commitment, which helps to get into better routines.
          I then started to focus more on routines and about habits during work days, about what they like about their daily work life and where the pain points are, what’s valued and tried to get a feeling for the team culture. I also tried to get
          deeper into the understanding and also their emotional life regarding work, to learn more about them and have a strong foundation to design a product with the human in the center. </p>

        <h3> Card Sorting activity </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_left plus2">
        <p>
          Based on the „Ideo DesignKit“, I’ve developed cards to use as a activity during our research phase. It’s a „quick and easy way to spark conversation about what matters most to the people you’re designing for“. By asking our interviewees to
          rank the cards according to what matters most to them, we’ve been able to get interesting additional insights:
          • Colleagues and fun as main importance
          • Social interaction highly valued all through
          • Interesting how people referred to their cards later on in the conversation, it seemed, like it helped to express feelings and structure thoughts for some people. (e.g. „like you’ve seen before in my cards, that’s not really of importance
          for me..“)

          Also, I’ve created Empathy Maps and a rough „Customer Journey Map“ thoughout that process.

        <p>
          Responsibility, noises, health-awareness & sustainability – these were the main clusters and patterns which emerged out of the analysis of our research. The bigger ones are the compelling insight we’ve heard again and again, the consistent
          problems people are facing and that came up all across the
          board.

      <div class="project_box_description_left plus2">
        <p>
          The next step was to bring structure into the main findings and decide with which points to move forward. To do so, I’ve used the technique of a lightning jam session based on the method of the „Design Sprint“ by AJ&Smart with the sailboat.
          On the upper half, we put all the point which are the delights & uppers. What brings and moves the boat forward? On the down side, we place all the the thorns, the downsides and the pain points. What holds the boat back?

          The goal hereby was: Reframing the problems in positive challenges.

          These were the three main directions and ideas con- sidered for our brand appearance. Each one of them has got its purpose connected to our brand core and at the same time, their purpose is to go into different directions so we develop a
          feel for what suits our core values the best.  The final decision fell on a mixture between the rocket mood and the jungle version. The fairy tale mood is playful and colourful, but neither embodies our tech nor our environmental cores.

        <p>
          The Tone of Voice is not what you say, but how you say it. This will inform all of the written copy, including website, social media messages, emails and packaging. It‘s only three simple key words to bear in mind when communicating with
          customers:<br><br>
          Competente <br>
          » reliable, respectful, trustworthy, facts in the back, transparent, predictable <br>
          Curious <br>
          » explanatory, educative and interested <br>
          Refreshing <br>

          The visual feel of rowa’s brand is highly based on the earlier on defined personality and the core values. The main focus of the chosen colours lays on the warm-heartedness and connection to earth. They symbolize playfulness in a
          combination with seriousity and simpli- city. The expressed feelings through the colours used stand for the core of the brand.

        <p>
          The final choice for the type fell on a rounded sans serif font, to emphasize the flow and the softness of water.
          It is a modern font, to support our tech-approach and as well to have the clean and simple appearance stated before. It might be seen as slightly playful, to transmit the „fun“ of it and the joy a rowa-system would spark.

          Through the leafs in the background, there‘s an immediate connection between logo and the actual product. The leaf isn‘t just a leaf, but when looking closely it‘s acutally also a water drop, which symolizes the hydroponic technology with
          which our plants grow. This is especially visible and noticable in the negative version of it.
          Overall, it‘s simple, explanatory and welcoming, which embodies three of rowa’s core values together.

          That process was based on „A Guide to Functional UX“ by Studio by UXPin. According to UXPin, „a prototype is a simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch.” So the goal of a prototype is to
          test products (and product ideas) before spending lots of time (and money) into the final product without knowing if it even actually works out for the user.
          Therefore, I started with prototyping little sketches to structure and understand the whole process, the components included and used that prototype for a team internal feedback round, in which I let them „test“ and understand the first
          very low-fidelity paper prototypes. That was very valuable, as it was a very fast, very simple way to get first understanding and feeling for what was experienced as important and not so important.
