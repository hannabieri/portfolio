        <h3> THE <b> PROBLEM</b></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_left expanding-border">
        <p> We spend our time working in offices. Often 8 hours a day, five days per week. That’s 160 hours per month and 1920 hours per year. There are plenty of studies showing the <b>indisputable relationship between physical space and business
            performance metrics</b>, productivity, and what employees value. But way too often, office space is a blind spot. Mid-sized companies in urban areas struggle to find simple and natural ways of enhancing their team dynamic and
          exchange between employees.
          At the same time, often an awareness for the actual office space surrounding employees on a daily base is missing.</p>

        <h3> THE Design <b>Challenge</b></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_right expanding-border">
        <p>The challenge in this project was, on the one hand, its broadness, but also combining the intended technology with real problems. The central question was how we might create workspaces which allow focused work and reduce
          noise-distraction.
          <b>Is
            it possible to contribute to a better working-experience through technology and design?</b> And how might we bring more sustainability and environmental awareness into office workspaces and offices? Could this even contribute to
          strengthening the (social) connections between different departments in a company? </p>

        <h3><b>Research</b> • Interviews </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_left plus1">
        <p>
          Qualitative Research, semi-structured interviews <br><br>

          I started with B2C interviews & conversations in public locations (e.g. shops). The main target hereby was to reach health- and environment- aware people in urban areas. The key learning out of the B2C-interviews was the following: It
          seemed like <b>there are pain points around, for example, lacking fresh and local products, packaging, price-
            and
            quality-balance, the effort and
            time-consumption of alternatives.</b> At the same time, it seemed like the “suffering” isn’t big enough to actually take proactive steps towards alternatives.<br><br>

          We also interviewed at companies. Whilst doing so, <b>there were some interesting fields and opportunities opening up.</b> For example, the desire for a strong team culture, which seemed emphasized over and over again. The point of the
          physical office space came up, too, and how it <b>influences employee's productivity.</b>
          Another
          area
          was accountability and commitment within teams, which helps colleagues to get into
          better collaboration routines.
          <br><br>
          As a result, I started to focus more on routines and habits during workdays, about what they like about their daily work life and where the pain points are, what’s valued and tried to get a <b>feeling for the team culture.</b> I also tried
          to get a
          deeper understanding of their emotional life regarding work, to learn more about pains and gains and have a strong foundation to design a product with the human in the centre. </p>

        <h3> Card Sorting activity </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_left plus1">
        <p>
          Based on the „Ideo DesignKit“, I’ve developed cards to use as an activity during our research phase. It’s a „quick and easy way to spark conversation about what matters most to the people you’re designing for“. By asking our interviewees to
          rank the cards according to what matters most to them, we’ve been able to get interesting additional insights. Also, it was interesting how people referred to their cards later on in the conversation, like it <b>helped to express feelings
            and structure thoughts </b>for some (e.g. „like you’ve seen before in my cards, that’s not really of
          importance
          for me“).
          <br>
          Also, I’ve created Empathy Maps and a rough „Customer Journey Map“ throughout that process.

          compelling insight we’ve heard

        <p>
          The next step was to bring structure into the main findings and decide with which points to move forward. To do so, I’ve used the technique of a lightning jam session based on the method of the „Design Sprint“ by AJ&Smart with the sailboat.
          On the upper half, we put all the points which are the delights & uppers. What brings and moves the boat forward? On the downside, we place all the thorns, the downsides and the pain points. What holds the boat back?

        <p>
          The goal hereby was: Reframing the problems in positive challenges.<br><br>
          <b>The top three were the following:</b><br>
          — How might we strengthen the
          (social) connections between
          different departments in a company?<br>
          — How might we create workspaces
          which allow focused work and reduce
          noise-distraction?<br>
          — How might we bring more
          sustainability into office workspaces
          and offices?<br><br>

          As a result out of the research & synthesis phases, we’ve had a clear problem and product definition and could move forward backed up by learnings and insights.<br>

          The next step was to generate ideas out of the insights of the research process and to build upon the knowledge we've gained there. <br>

          These were the three main directions and ideas considered for our brand appearance. Each one of them has got its purpose connected to our brand core, and at the same time, their purpose is to go into different directions, so we develop a
          feel for what suits our core values the best.The final decision fell on a mixture between the rocket mood and the jungle version. The fairy tale mood is playful and colourful, but neither embodies our tech nor our environmental cores.

          The Tone of Voice is not what to say, but how to say it. This will inform all of our written copies, including website, social media messages, emails and packaging. It‘s only three simple key words to bear in mind when communicating with
          customers:<br><br>
          <b>Competente </b><br>
          » reliable, respectful, trustworthy, facts in the back, transparent, predictable <br>

          The visual feel of rowa’s brand is highly based on the earlier on defined personality and the core values. The main focus of the chosen colours lays on the <b>warm-heartedness and connection to earth.</b> They symbolize playfulness in a
          combination with seriousity and simplicity. The expressed feelings through the colours used represent the core of the brand.

          It is <b>a modern font, to support our tech-approach and as well to have the clean and simple appearance stated before. </b>It might be seen as slightly playful, to transmit the „fun“ of it and the joy a rowa-system would spark.

          That process was based on „A Guide to Functional UX“ by Studio by UXPin. According to UXPin, „a prototype is a simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch.” So the goal of a prototype is to
          test products (and product ideas) before spending lots of time (and money) into the final product without knowing if it even actually works out for the user.
          Therefore, I started with prototyping little sketches to structure and understand the whole process, the components included and used that prototype for a team internal feedback round, in which I let them „test“ and understand the first
          very low-fidelity paper prototypes. <b>That was very valuable, as it was a very fast, very simple way to get first understanding and feeling for what was experienced as important and not so important.</b>

          interface, for which I created the interface and defined the different access points.
