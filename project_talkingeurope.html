        <h3> THE <b> PROBLEM</b></h3>
      </div>


      <div class="project_box_description_left">
        <p> Discussions about politics in your everyday life?
          Happens rarely, and can also be quite touchy. The same is true
          for social networks: To have <b>a fact-based, rational discussion
            about politics without trolls, hate comments and attacs seems an
            impossibility. </b>And if so, it usually takes place in the same setting, the ever-same group of friends, or the same-minded family – in one’s own little bubbel. <b>But isn’t discussion one of the keystones of a democracy?</b> That’s why
          the
          idea for
          Diskutier Mit Mir and later on Talking Europe was born.</p>

        <h3> THE <b>APPROACH</b></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_right">
        <p>Talking Europe is a pan-European platform for political dialogue. The application works with an algorithm, which <b>connects citicenz from different European countries with someone who’s got another point of view</b>. In an anonymous
          1:1 chat, political topics can get discussed based on suggested theses. Thanks to an implemented live translation tool, everyone’s able to discuss in their mother tongue and therefore, language barriers can be eliminated. Like this,<b>
            political dialogue in the web is made possible</b> and the so-called filter bubbles get bursted.</p>

        <h3><b>Design</b> • User Interface </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="project_box_description_left plus1">
        <p>Talking Europe was built on the existing concept of Diskutier Mit Mir. The approach is simple: You answer five questions and then get matched with someone who answered these questions as contrary to you as possible.
          I incorporated the existing concept and continuously worked on further optimizations and improvements for the international project.

          This was achieved by <b>taking the new, intercultural aspects into account: from the choice of language on the very first screen to the visualization and communication of the translation.</b> Other challenges in this project were to convey
          aspects
          such as neutrality and security. The platform should feel like a "safe space" to the user, and invite to discuss. Engagement and involvement were key terms, which strongly influenced the design work. It was crucial to differentiate
          between "not just another messenger tool" and communicating the matter of concern. </p>

        <h3> Campaign </h3>
        <p>Especially for the European Parliment Elections in 2019, I’ve developed a concept for various sharepics according to the Corporate Design. They built upon components out of the interface and picked up certain contents, for example the
          theses which a user can answer and discuss in the app. Like this, Talking Europe was able to reach people via social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. As mentioned before, <b>it’s been important to not reach out to a specific
            political group but rather celebrate the variety of opinions and the disagreement,</b> which leads to interesting discussions on the platform.</p>
